            <strong>Aussie Home Loans</strong> <br /><br />
            As a Mortgage Broker at Aussie Home Loans, I embarked on a journey
            of financial empowerment for my clients. <br />
            My role extended far beyond facilitating mortgage transactions; it
            was about understanding individual needs and crafting tailored
            financial solutions. Guiding clients through the intricate maze of
            mortgage applications, I provided personalized advice and expert
            guidance. Cultivating lasting relationships with a diverse clientele
            was integral to my approach, fostering trust and loyalty. I took
            pride in my ability to conduct thorough financial analyses,
            evaluating risk profiles to match clients with suitable loan
            products. Collaboration was key; working seamlessly with
            underwriting teams, I streamlined processes to ensure a seamless
            experience for clients. Exceeding sales targets was not merely a
            metric but a testament to my dedication to delivering exceptional
            service and driving revenue growth.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>KPMG</strong> <br />
            <br />
            My tenure at KPMG as a Remediation Consultant was characterized by
            meticulous attention to detail and a commitment to excellence.
            Tasked with assessing the services provided by financial planners
            for a major bank, I delved deep into risk analysis and mitigation
            strategies. Operating within a high-performance environment, I
            consistently ranked among the top performers, leveraging my
            expertise to deliver insightful reports to senior management.
            Collaboration was ingrained in our ethos; actively engaging with
            colleagues and senior management, I contributed to enhancing project
            methodologies and assessment guidelines. My tenure at KPMG was a
            testament to my ability to thrive under pressure, demonstrating
            resilience and adaptability in a fast-paced environment.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>RSM Sydney (Audit Assurance)</strong> <br /><br />
            At RSM Sydney, I honed my skills in audit and assurance, gaining
            valuable insights into financial reporting and compliance. Engaged
            in various audit testing procedures, I assisted in generating
            financial reports and proofing documents. Proficiency in audit
            software was imperative, as I navigated through tasks with
            meticulous attention to detail. Working within a collaborative team
            environment, I contributed to completing audit programs and
            enhancing organizational processes. My time at RSM Sydney
            underscored the importance of precision and accuracy in financial
            reporting, laying the groundwork for my future endeavors.
            <br /><br />
            <strong>Education</strong> <br /><br />
            My educational journey has been a testament to my commitment to
            personal and professional growth. Armed with a Bachelor of Commerce
            with an Accounting Major, I have cultivated a strong foundation in
            financial management and analysis. My pursuit of certifications,
            including Cert IV in Finance and Mortgage Broking and TAE40116 Cert
            IV in Training and Assessing, reflects my dedication to expanding my
            skill set and staying abreast of industry trends. <br /><br />
            <strong>Volunteer Experience</strong> <br /><br />
            <em>St Mary St Bakhomios Coptic Orthodox Church</em> <br />
            Volunteering has always been a cornerstone of my values, providing
            me with a sense of purpose and fulfillment. At St Mary St Bakhomios
            Coptic Orthodox Church, I engaged in monthly groundskeeping and
            maintenance works, contributing to the upkeep of communal spaces and
            fostering a sense of community spirit. <br /><br />
            <strong> Interests</strong> <br /><br />
            Beyond the realm of professional endeavors, I am passionate about
            exploring new technologies and experimenting with coding projects.
            Personal development literature fuels my curiosity, as I constantly
            seek opportunities for growth and self-improvement. Volunteering
            remains close to my heart, and I actively seek out avenues to give
            back to causes that resonate with me. Whether it's attending
            workshops, staying active within my community, or immersing myself
            in creative pursuits, I am driven by a thirst for knowledge and a
            desire to make a meaningful impact.
